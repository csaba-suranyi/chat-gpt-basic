This is just a warm up project for a Python ChatGPT call. It stems from Utku Sen's Book Securing ChatGPT: A Practical Introduction to Attack and Defend ChatGTP Applications ( :+1: https://utkusen.gumroad.com/l/securing-gpt-attack-defend-chatgpt-applications). 
With this few lines of code my journey started and I hope it will be a great journey for all of us :)
