# Day Zero

This is just a warm up project for a Python ChatGPT call. It stems from Utku Sen's Book Securing ChatGPT: A Practical Introduction to Attack and Defend ChatGTP Applications ( :+1: https://utkusen.gumroad.com/l/securing-gpt-attack-defend-chatgpt-applications). I made a little modification to that. 

With this few lines of code my journey started towards a fast evolving future, which embrace AI and I hope it will be a great journey for all of us :)

Please read the answer I got from the ChatGPT-3.5 modell for the question: "What is the capitol of Hungary?"

'''
Yo, the capital of Hungary, that's Budapest,
A city so fly, it's truly the best,
With the Danube river flowin' through its heart,
Culture and history, it's a true work of art.
'''

Never forget, it's all about the System Prompt!
